    <string name="mock_long_string">When I was young I\'d listen to the radio\nWaiting for my
    favorite songs\nWhen they played I\'d sing along\nIt make me smile\nThose were such happy
    times and not so long ago\nHow I wondered where they\'d gone\nBut they\'re back again just like
    a long lost friend\nAll the songs I love so well\nEvery shalala every wo\'wostill
    shines\nEvery shing-a-ling-a-ling that they\'re starting to sing so fine\nWhen they get to the
    part\nWhere he\'s breaking her heart\nIt can really make me cry\nJust like before\nIt\'s
    yesterday once more\n(Shoobie do lang lang*)\n(Shoobie do lang lang)\nLooking back on how it
    was in years gone by\nAnd the good times that I had\nMakes today seem rather sad\nSo much has
    changed\nIt was songs of love that I would sing to them\nAnd I\'d memorise each word\nThose
    old melodies still sound so good to me\nAs they melt the years away\nEvery shalala every
    wo\'wo still shines\nEvery shing-a-ling-a-ling that they\'re starting to sing so fine\nAll my
    best memories\nCome back clearly to me\nSome can even make me cry\nJust like before\nIt\'s
    yesterday once more\n(Shoobie do lang lang)\nEvery shalala every wo\'wo still shines\nEvery
    shing-a-ling-a-ling that they\'re starting to sing so fine\nEvery shalala every wo\'wo still
    shines\nEvery shing-a-ling-a-ling that they\'re starting to sing so fine</string>
